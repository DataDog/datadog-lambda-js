# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/datadog-lambda-layer-js.git
```

Make your change, update tests and ensure the tests pass (install Docker if you haven't):

```bash
npm test
```

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/your-username/datadog-lambda-layer-js/compare/DataDog:master...master

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
