Datadog Lambda Library for Node.js (12.x, 14.x, 16.x, and 18.x) enables enhanced Lambda metrics, distributed tracing, and custom metric submission from AWS Lambda functions.

## Installation

Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/installation/nodejs/), and view your function's enhanced metrics, traces and logs in Datadog.

## Configuration

Follow the [configuration instructions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/serverless/configuration) to tag your telemetry, capture request/response payloads, filter or scrub sensitive information from logs or traces, and more.

For additional tracing configuration options, check out the [official documentation for Datadog trace client](https://datadoghq.dev/dd-trace-js/).

## Major Version Notes

### 5.x.x

The 5.x.x release introduces version 2 of the Datadog tracer, [dd-trace-js](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-js/). This includes a few breaking changes, and the migration guide found [here](https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-js/blob/master/MIGRATING.md#nested-objects-as-tags).

The first 5.x.x version was released with Lambda Layer version `69`.

### 6.x.x

The 6.x.x release introduces support for the node 16 runtime and esm modules. 

#### Breaking Changes
If you are using node 12 and installing the NPM module instead of the layer, redirecting your handler to the path `node_modules/datadog-lambda-js/dist/handler.handler` will no longer work. The path should be updated to `node_modules/datadog-lambda-js/dist/handler.handler.cjs`. This won't affect users of node 14, 16, or users of node 12 with the lambda layer.
